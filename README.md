# Ancestry-specific IBD

This code computes ancestry-specific IBD based on local ancestry results from RFMix v2 (https://github.com/slowkoni/rfmix) and IBD sharing results estimated with refined IBD (https://faculty.washington.edu/browning/refined-ibd.html).
It was applied to southern African populations in the following publication:
"Genome wide variation in the Angolan Namib desert reveals unique Pre-Bantu ancestry" from Oliveira et al.
